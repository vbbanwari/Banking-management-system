# Banking Management System

## Overview
The Banking Management System is a project designed to replicate basic banking operations, such as account creation, balance inquiry, fund deposit and withdrawal, and money transfers. This project focuses on designing efficient data structures and algorithms to handle banking operations securely and accurately, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

## Features
1. **Account Management**
   - Create, update, and delete user accounts.
2. **Transactions**
   - Deposit and withdraw funds.
   - Transfer money between accounts.
3. **Reports**
   - Generate reports sorted by account balances.
4. **Search Functionality**
   - Quickly locate accounts using efficient search algorithms.
5. **Concurrency Handling**
   - Support multiple simultaneous transactions while maintaining data consistency.

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Data Structures:**
   - Implement multiple data structures such as linked lists, arrays, and hash tables for storing and managing user details.
2. **Algorithm Development:**
   - Use searching, sorting, and data manipulation techniques to optimize banking operations.
3. **Database Management:**
   - Store and retrieve account information securely and efficiently.
4. **Data Consistency:**
   - Handle multiple concurrent transactions while ensuring data integrity.

## Execution Steps
### 1. Core Banking Operations
   - Account management: Create, update, delete accounts.
   - Transaction handling: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money.
   - Reporting: Generate account balance reports.

### 2. Data Structures and Algorithms
   - Use **arrays/lists** for storing account details.
   - Use **queues/stacks** for managing transaction sequences.
   - Apply sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) for report generation.
   - Implement searching algorithms (e.g., binary search) for account lookup.

### 3. Organizational Hierarchy
   - Utilize **trees/graphs** for hierarchical data and access control.

### 4. Security and Validation
   - Input validation for transactions to prevent errors.
   - Error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness.
